# [Description] ------------------------------
# Module name "Reservoir_retrieval.py"
# This module loops through the dam points to retrieve their associated reservoir polygons from a given
# water mask (such as HydroLAKES).The retrieval process involves two consecutive rounds, with the first
# using a 500-m spatial tolerance and the second using a 1-km tolerance. Each round consists of another
# three iterations to progressively optimize reservoir-dam association. The output is one-to-one
# relationship (one dam point associated with one reservoir polygon). Although the goal is to retrieve
# reservoirs as thoroughly as possible, there is no guarantee that reservoirs for all dam points can be
# assigned. Detailed methods are described in Wang et al. (2021).

# Inputs
# 1. work_dir: full path of the workspace or geodatabase
work_dir = r"...\workspace"

# 2. Dams: dam point feature class (such as GeoDAR_v11_dams)
Dams = "GeoDAR_v11_dams"

# 3. Water_mask: water polygon feature class (such as HydroLAKES)
# Since the following reservoir retrieval algorithm involves polygon area comparison, Water_mask must be
# first projected into an equal-area projection.

# 1. matched_lakes: lake polygons (as in Water_mask) that are paired/matched with dams points (as in Dams).

# 2. notmatched_dams: the remaining dam points in Dams that are left unpaired with lake/reservoir polygons.
